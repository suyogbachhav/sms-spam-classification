In the project I applied many classification algorithm for better Accuracy and Precision.  
Machine Learing Alorithms : 
1. Multinomial Naive Bayes
2. Gaussian Naive Bayes
3. Bernoulli Naive Bayes
4. Decision Tree
5. Logistic Regression
6. Random Forest
7. Ada Boost
8. Bagging Classifier
9. Extra Trees
10. Gradient Boosting
11. X Gradient Boosting

Multinomial Naive Bayes performed best among all algorithms
